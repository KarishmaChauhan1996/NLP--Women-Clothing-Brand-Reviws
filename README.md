**Project Overview**

This project applies various NLP techniques to understand customer feedback for a clothing brand. By analyzing reviews, we aim to uncover insights into customer satisfaction, identify common themes, and perform sentiment analysis. These insights can help inform business decisions around product development, customer service, and marketing strategies.

* Numpy
* seaborn
* matplolib
* sklearn
* nltk
* string
* textblob
* wordcloud

**Data Preprocessing**

Data preprocessing steps include:

* Cleaning Text: Removing special characters, numbers, and extra whitespace.
* Lowercasing: Converting all text to lowercase for consistency.
* Tokenization: Breaking down sentences into individual words.
* Stopword Removal: Removing common words that do not add value to the analysis.
* Lemmatization: Converting words to their root forms (e.g., "running" to "run").
* Handling Missing Values: Filling or dropping missing values as appropriate.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

Exploratory analysis was conducted to understand the distribution of:

Customer Age Groups: Visualizing customer demographics.
Ratings: Analyzing the rating distribution and identifying any skewness.
Recommendation Patterns: Understanding factors that drive customer recommendations.
Top Words: Identifying the most common words in positive and negative reviews.
Visualization techniques like histograms, box plots, and bar charts were used for EDA.

**NLP Analysis**

**1. Sentiment Analysis**

Using TextBlob and VADER, we performed sentiment analysis on each review to categorize them as positive, negative, or neutral. This helps gauge overall customer sentiment towards products.

**2. Topic Modeling**

Using techniques like Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), we identified key themes/topics in the reviews. This provided insight into common issues, popular features, or trends among customers.

**3. Word Clouds**

Generated word clouds to visualize frequent words in positive and negative reviews, highlighting what customers like or dislike about products.

**4. Sentiment Analysis by Segments**

Conducted sentiment analysis across various segments, including:

* Age Groups: Identifying sentiment trends in different age demographics.
* Product Categories: Understanding sentiment by product type.
* Location: Analyzing sentiment by customer location.

**Model Evaluation**

The NLP models and techniques were evaluated using:

Sentiment Accuracy: Cross-checking with actual recommendations to validate sentiment predictions.
Topic Coherence: Using coherence scores to evaluate the quality of topic modeling.
Word Cloud Validation: Cross-verifying word clouds against common topics identified in reviews.
Results and Interpretation
Key insights gained from the analysis include:

Customer Satisfaction: Overall sentiment trends and specific factors driving satisfaction or dissatisfaction.
Product Improvement: Identified areas where the brand could improve based on common negative feedback.
Targeted Marketing: Developed recommendations for targeting specific demographics based on sentiment and preferences.
